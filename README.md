**Introduction**

The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a risk score used to assess the risk of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation (AF). The score is calculated by assigning points based on a person's age, sex, and the presence of certain risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and vascular disease.

**What is the code for calculating the CHA2DS2-VASc score?**

The code for calculating the CHA2DS2-VASc score is as follows:

```python
def calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score(age, sex, congestive_heart_failure, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, vascular_disease):
    score = 0

    # Assign points based on age
    if age >= 75:
        score += 2
    elif age >= 65:
        score += 1

    # Assign points based on sex (Female: 1 point)
    if sex == 'F':
        score += 1

    # Assign points for comorbidities
    if congestive_heart_failure:
        score += 1
    if hypertension:
        score += 1
    if diabetes:
        score += 1

    # Assign points for previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
    if stroke:
        score += 2

    # Assign points for presence of vascular disease
    if vascular_disease:
        score += 1

    return score
```

**How to use the code**

To use the code, you will need to:

1. Import the code into your Python environment.
2. Define the input parameters, such as the person's age, sex, and the presence of risk factors.
3. Calculate the score using the `calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score()` function.
4. Print the score.

**Example usage**

The following code shows how to use the code to calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score for a person who is 70 years old, male, has congestive heart failure, hypertension, and diabetes, and has had a stroke:

```python
age = 70
sex = 'M'
congestive_heart_failure = True
hypertension = True
diabetes = True
stroke = True
vascular_disease = False

score = calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score(age, sex, congestive_heart_failure, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, vascular_disease)
print(f"CHA2DS2-VASc Score: {score}")
```

This code will print the following output:

```
CHA2DS2-VASc Score: 5
```

**Interpreting the score**

The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a continuous variable, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of stroke. The following table shows the interpretation of the CHA2DS2-VASc score:

Score | Risk of stroke
------- | --------
0 | <1%
1 | 1-2%
2 | 2-3%
3 | 4-5%
4 | 6-8%
5 | 10-12%
